									<h1>Burning Money: Making Art for Blackrock City</h1>
								</header>

								<p>Every year 50,000+ people trek to the alkali flats of Black Rock Desert, Nevada, to create a temporary city where the expectations of society and self fall away and allow them to explore what it means to be them.... yadda yadda yadda. It's also a place where a bunch of kickin' rad art gets made, because crazy people like me spend their whole year making stuff to take out there. I've been going off and on for 6 years now, and I've been making art for it even when I haven't been able to make it out.</p>
								<h2>The City</h2>
								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NUODPOE.jpg" class="thumbnail portrait"/>
								<p>These are the main zones for big art. Throughout the rest of the city there are theme camps, where the people who stay there provide some sort of interactive experience for the participants at Burning Man.</p>
								<p>Here's a map of art and theme camp locations from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1w25_ugthwsCoMaeNOn1nAjOsz20&ll=40.78386160415719%2C-119.19899526676608&z=14">2017</a>.</p>
								<h2>The Four Kinds of Burning Man Art</h2>

								<h3>Installations</h3>
								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D4pyhq9.jpg" class="thumbnail landscape"/>
								<p>An art installation at BM is any pieceâ˜º that lives away from your camp and stays in one place. They range in size from about as big as a person to towering structures a hundred feet tall and hundreds of feet across. They are set up on Playa (in the desert) before the event starts, though construction often spills into the week as things go wrong and run late. Many burn in ceremonies throughout the week, but others come back multiple years or find a home out in the default (not BM) world. Interactivity is a big theme with installations - most have something that participants can do with them from simply climbing on them to controlling lights, motion, or sound, to puzzles or rituals. Most installations are found on the Inner Playa, but they are also in the Keyholes and scattered across the Outer Playa. While not all installations receive art grants, a list of those that did from past years can be found <url="https://burningman.org/culture/history/art-history/archive/">here</url>.</p>

								<h3>Mutant Vehicles</h3>
								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RsP6nmB.jpg" class="thumbnail landscape"/>
								<p>Mutant vehicles are art cars, but not your kooky man in the local parade kind. Anything motor powered that can transport multiple people counts, but to get licensed to drive around during the event, it needs to be radically transformed. The Department of Mutant Vehicles has been getting stricter in the past few years as more and more people want to bring art cars, they now want every part of the base vehicle to be hidden or changed. DO NOT BUILD AN ART CAR BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WILL BE CONVENIENT TO RIDE AROUND THE PLAYA. Mutant Vehicles take a ton of work, require constant maintenance, and involve a lot of management. They are a giant pain in the ass. They are also the coolest thing I've ever done.</p>

								<h3>Theme Camps</h3>
								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JNWSJzx.jpg" class="thumbnail landscape"/>
								<p>Theme camps provide a participatory experience from being a bar serving free booze to hosting performances to washing people to teaching workshops to rope bondage. There is a seemingly endless variety of activities or experiences going on at any given time. Physical art for theme camps includes pieces in the camp itself, but also the architecture for the camp. Stages, bars, domes, shade structures, things to climb on or sit in, advanced living arrangements, it all lives here.</p>

								<h3>Personal Art</h3>
								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/V3rYX5m.jpg" class="thumbnail landscape"/>
								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nSqho0R.jpg" class="thumbnail landscape"/>
								<p>From costumes to bikes to ride around on, people go all out on decorating themselves and their things. This is the type that I've done the least with, though I'd like to do more in the future. The city is huge; it can easily take an hour to get from one side to the other on foot and small mutant vehicles aren't super common, so bikes are the main form of transportation. While most burner bikes are beach cruisers with some fur glued on, people take it way further than that. I had one bike I was pretty happy with that I can't find any pictures of, but I'd really like to do something more elaborate some year in the future. Same for clothing and props - some year I'll take off from doing the big art and focus on making personal things.</p>

								<h3>The Borg</h3>
								<p>What makes Burning Man special is that the attendees bring the art and do the performances. They aren't provided by the festival. However, The Borg (Burning Man Organization) does do some stuff for art:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>The Man, an entirely on the nose metaphor in the form a giant wooden man what burns in effigy on Saturday night. The man burn is the climax of burning man, a spectacular show where everyone gathers and celebrates.
								<li>The Temple, a place for saying goodbye to whatever you need to leave behind. It burns Sunday night and is the only time you'll experience quiet in a crowd at the burn, unless some asshole decides it'd be funny to play Freebird.
								<li>Art grants, in the form of the <a href="https://burningman.org/culture/burning-man-arts/grants/brc-honoraria">Black Rock City Honoraria Program</a>. These are only for installations.
								<li>Some tickets reserved for those bringing art to buy.
								<li>Placement for installations and theme camps.
								<li>Permits for mutant vehicles.
								<li>Fire safety inspection and permits.
								</ul>
